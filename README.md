# Mrcp Paces Cardiovascular Examination
  
- Fully revised for the new Station 5 and completely updated throughout.

- Promotes understanding and deeper learning of modern medicine applicable to PACES and the specialist registrar.

- Emphasis on clinical assessment - history-taking, examination and communication skills - equipping candidates with appropriate differential diagnoses from which to develop the right diagnosis.

- Encourages candidates to question *why* a diagnosis has arisen and consider its consequences. For example, 'Heat failure' is a not a diagnosis until a candidate has considered the differential diagnoses of breathlessness and decided why heart failure is most likely, and then considered its cause (not always ischaemic heart disease), its presentation (acute, chronic, left or right ventricular or both) and, most importantly, the effects of it and its treatments on a patient's life.

 This 3rd edition of PACES for the MRCP continues to provide fully revised, up-to-date, evidence-based coverage of investigations and treatments. Whilst the emphasis of PACES is on clinical skills, candidates who understand when, for example, a patient with rheumatoid arthritis might benefit from a biologic agent and how this will influence inflammatory disease, is better equipped for success. 
'Hall's *PACES for the MRCP* is excellent. It is easy to follow, carefully laid out and covers all conditions likely to appear in each station of the exam. The author not only explains examination techniques and clinical signs, but also goes that step further to ensure the reader really understands each topic, using clinical examples, question and answer/discussion sections as well as detailed illustrations. Where this text also outshines the others is with the inclusion of chapters covering the History Taking and Communication/Ethics stations of the exam. The scenarios are "spot on" and give the reader plenty of examples to work through. The Neurology section is brilliant.' Overall: An excellent and up-to-date text, this is the new MRCP "Bible" - don't sit your exam without it.

Really good book. The clinical stations are well covered - in particular this book is worth buying just for the neuro section alone which is really easy to read and understand and gives you a great framework for approaching clinical cases (this is also what countless colleagues of mine have cited as the book's main selling point!)
 
'This is an excellent book. It is very well-written, clear, factually correct and actually means that you know enough to hold a conversation with the examiners. Apparently most people assume they will pass the Hx and comm stations but commonly fail them and this book is excellent for those with lots of information and cases to practice. I really feel that this book has transformed the paces market as it is so much better than the others.'
 
You must demonstrate good technique when examining the major clinical systems (respiratory, abdomen, cardiovascular and neurological) in a thorough and methodical manner. At Station 1 and 3, you have to complete your examination in no more than 6 minutes.
 
All cancellations need to be made through your account. For those who do not attend without cancellation, your line manager will be notified and a possible charge may be incurred. All paid events have a strict cancellations policy.
 
Upon completion of this course a certificate will be available for you to download from your account along with any other post course information. Please ensure you complete your feedback so we are able to continuously improve our training.
 
You are assessed on your ability to carry out essential clinical skills. In this half-day examination, you go to a clinical setting and visit five stations where there are patients with a given condition. At each station, there will be two independent examiners who will observe and evaluate your performance based on seven core skills.

Stations 1, 3 and 5 have two encounters and 2 and 4 involve one encounter meaning a total of eight patients will be seen. Before seeing each case, you will receive written instructions as to what is required. An allocated amount of time is then spent with each patient for each case, followed by a set time with questioning from the examiners.
 
Yes. MRCP(UK) continues to closely monitor COVID-19 infection rates and the impact this may have on upcoming PACES exams. Consequently, there have been some changes to the format. Stations 1, 3 and 5 will retain the existing carousel format, using real patients and assessing the same seven skills as before. The time at each station will remain the same but additional time will be added between clinical encounters for changes to PPE and any items to be thoroughly cleaned.
 
Stations 2 and 4 along with a 20-minute rest period will form another 3-station mini-cycle. This will run in the same centre on the same day as the original mini-cycle. These stations will be run remotely. You will interact with the patient or surrogate via video link, and your questioning from the examiners will also be via video link. Many of you will have become familiar with telephone and video consultations since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The skills required are the same as for face to face consultations, but the remote nature of the consultation means that you may need to modify your approach.
 
UK PACES spaces are prioritised for UK trainees; any remaining places are then allocated to non-UK trainees on a first-come-first-served basis. Apply through your My MRCP(UK) account and late applications are not accepted.
 
Applications open for one week, three times a year. The assessment period is then finalised and will be confirmed in the following weeks, exam dates can fall on any day during the three-month assessment period for your application including weekends. Admission documents, containing your allocated examination date, time and location will be sent a minimum of four weeks in advance of your examination date.
